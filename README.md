# AgroBazar

## Introduction
Small-scale farmers form the backbone of global food production, contributing significantly to food security and rural economies. However, they face numerous barriers that hinder their ability to thrive in the marketplace. A major issue is their limited access to fair markets, lack of price transparency, and challenges in directly connecting with buyers. These issues result in low profitability, economic instability, and an inability to scale their agricultural operations.

## Challenges Faced by Small-Scale Farmers

### A. Market Access Barriers
- Farmers rely on middlemen who take significant cuts, reducing profits.
- Traditional markets are inaccessible due to poor infrastructure and transportation issues.
- Existing eCommerce platforms are not farmer-friendly, requiring marketing expertise and incurring high costs.

### B. Lack of Price Transparency
- Farmers lack access to real-time market prices, making them vulnerable to exploitation.
- Seasonal price fluctuations reduce bargaining power.
- Without direct buyer connections, farmers cannot set fair prices for their produce.

### C. Limited Direct Buyer-Farmer Connection
- A gap exists between farmers and consumers (individual buyers, restaurants, and retailers).
- Multiple layers in the supply chain cause delays and reduce farmers' profits.
- Many farmers lack digital tools to sell directly to consumers.

### D. Unsustainable Agricultural Practices
- Without a stable income, farmers struggle to invest in sustainable farming methods.
- Unsustainable farming leads to soil degradation and increased carbon footprints.

## Issues with Existing eCommerce Solutions

- High transaction fees reduce profits.
- Complex user interfaces are not designed for farmers with limited digital literacy.
- Farmers struggle with marketing and branding against large agribusinesses.
- Lack of localized support makes participation difficult for rural farmers.
